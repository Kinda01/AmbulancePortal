        <li>Airway - Check if the airway is clear.</li>
        <li>Breathing - Ensure that the patient is breathing adequately.</li>
        <li>Circulation - Check pulse, blood pressure, and look for signs of bleeding.</li>
        <li>Disability - Check the patient's level of consciousness (AVPU).</li>
